1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:07,760
“97 percent of climate scientists agree
that climate change is real.”

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:14,020
How many times have you heard that statement?
Probably hundreds. It may seem like a compelling

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,650
and scientific argument against fossil fuels,
but it’s one of the most illogical, unscientific

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,450
arguments you can make. To see how, let’s
use this form of argument

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,670
for another controversial product, vaccines.

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,310
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,310
says, “97 percent of doctors

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,450
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,450

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,300
What would you say in response?
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,300
9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,730
You’d probably say, “Yeah but the benefits
far outweigh the side effects.”
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,730
10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,440
By saying that “97% of doctors agree that
vaccine side effects are real” without mentioning

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,490
any of the benefits of vaccines, the anti-vaccine
activist is trying to get you to look at the

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,650
potential dangers of vaccines out of context.

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,940
When fossil fuel opponents say “97 percent
of climate scientists agree that climate change

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,830
is real,” they are doing the same. Yes,
using fossil fuels for energy has a side effect—increasing

15
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,590
the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Okay.
But what about the upside? In the case of

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:20,330
fossil fuel that upside is enormous: the cheap,
plentiful, and reliable energy that makes

17
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:26,000
modern life possible, and at a scale no other
energy source can match.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320
So, how significant is the side effect? This
raises another problem with the statement

19
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,130
“97% percent of climate scientists agree
that climate change is real.” It tells us

20
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,150
nothing about the meaning or magnitude of
“climate change”—whether it’s a mild,

21
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,250
manageable warming or a runaway, catastrophic
warming. This is an example of the fallacy

22
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,469
of equivocation—using the same term in different,
contradictory ways.

23
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,669
If someone were to say “97% of doctors agree
that vaccine side effects are real,”

24
00:01:57,669 --> 00:02:02,460
what exact “vaccine side effects” do the doctors
agree on? That a certain number of babies

25
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:10,199
will get a rash? Or that large percentages
will get full-blown autism? Precision is key, right?

26
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,160
But fossil fuel opponents don’t want you
to know the precise magnitude of climate change.

27
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,270
Because if you did you wouldn’t be scared
of climate change,

28
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,870
you would be scared of losing the benefits of fossil fuels.

29
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,060
For example, listen to how Secretary of State John Kerry manipulates the “97 percent of scientists” line.

30
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,840
“97 percent of climate
scientists have confirmed that climate change

31
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:37,940
is happening and that human activity is responsible,”
he said in a speech in Indonesia in 2014.

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,620
Later, in the same speech, he claimed that
Scientists agree that, “The world as we

33
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,630
know it will change—and it will change dramatically
for the worse.” 97 percent of climate scientists

34
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,890
never said any such thing.

35
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:57,960
So what did the 97 percent actually say? It
turns out, nothing remotely resembling catastrophic

36
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,650
climate change. One of the main studies justifying
97 percent was done by John Cook, a climate

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,819
communications fellow for the Global Change
Institute in Australia. Here’s his own summary

38
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,900
of his survey: “Cook et al. found
that over 97 percent [of papers surveyed]

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,250
endorsed the view that the Earth is warming
up and human emissions of greenhouse gases

40
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,420
are the main cause.”

41
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,720
“Main cause” means “over 50 percent.
But the vast majority of papers don’t say

42
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,670
that human beings are the main cause of recent
warming. In fact, one analysis showed

43
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,160
that less than 2 percent of papers actually said that.

44
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:40,519
How did Cook get to 97 percent, then? First,
he added papers that explicitly said there

45
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,030
was man-made warming but didn’t say how
much. Then, he added papers that didn’t

46
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,790
even say there was man-made warming, but he
thought it was implied.

47
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,570
A scientific researcher has a sacred obligation
to accurately report his findings.

48
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,260
Cook and researchers like him have failed us—as have
the politicians and media figures who have

49
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,060
blindly repeated the 97 percent claim to support
their anti-fossil fuel goals.

50
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,959
How can we protect ourselves against this
kind of manipulation? Whenever someone tells

51
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,219
you that scientists agree on something, ask
two questions: “What exactly do they agree on?

52
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,500
And, “How did they prove it?”

53
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,680
